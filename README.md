# Ising Model with Kawasaki Dynamics

This project consists of a Python program that simulates the 2D Ising model with conserved total magnetization (Kawasaki dynamics). The program create a .gif file that shows the time evolution of the system for a given temperature (k is proportional to 1/T). The length of the lattice and the total number of steps can be modified.

# # Some examples

Lattice with length L=16, total steps=10^5 (10^2 steps between frames)

Lattice with length L=32, total steps=10^7 (10^4 steps between frames)
